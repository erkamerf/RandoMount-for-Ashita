# RandoMountAshita
A FFXI Ashita addon to select a random mount from those that you own!

Clone this repo, or copy/paste RandoMountAshita.lua and mounts.lua inside a folder, also named RandoMountAshita. Place this repo/folder inside your Ashita/addons directory.

In-game, you can type `/addon load RandoMountAshita` to get it up and running. We recommend adding this command to a custom script (such as `load_addons.txt`) in the scripts folder. We recommend **against** using `Default.txt` as it may fail to initialize the  randomizer.

Once RandoMountAshita is loaded, you can use the command `/RandoMount` or `/rmount` to Mount UP! with a randomly chosen mount you have unlocked. This addon will not use the trainer's whistle.

Happy Adventuring!
