# RandoMountAshita
A FFXI Ashita addon to select a random mount from those that you own!

Clone this repo, or copy/paste RandoMountAshita.lua and mounts.lua inside a folder, also named RandoMountAshita. Place this repo/folder inside your Ashita/addons directory.

In-game, you can type `/addon load RandoMountAshita` to get it up and running. You can also append this command to the end of Default.txt, in the scripts folder. That'll make it automatically load when you log in.

Once RandoMountAshita is loaded, you can use the command `/RandoMount` or `/rmount` to Mount UP! with a randomly chosen mount you have unlocked. This addon will not use the trainer's whistle.

Happy Adventuring!
